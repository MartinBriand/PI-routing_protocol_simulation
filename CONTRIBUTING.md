# Contributing to the project
This is the development of a model to evaluate the performance of a dynamic routing protocol for the PI (to understand the protocol, see the `README.md` file). As a personal research project, it is open to any hint or help, but not much to contributions.

If you feel very interested by the paper and would like to contribute, please write an email to forename.lastnameatdomain (where domain is `the-klu.org`). If accepted, you will see that we use a [gitflow workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow). However, any free pull request without notifying me before that you want to join the development will be rejected.

Note that if a paper is ever published, the development of the repository will be stoped for reproducibility purpose.

In any case, you are free to fork the project and make your own development if you want to, that is the reason why the repo is public ;)
