# Contributing to the project
This project is the result of a research to find a PI protocol taking payments into account. This was done to evaluate the performance of the protocol (which turned out to be pretty good if you want to read the paper). The protocol still has many shortcoming though (some of them are listed in the paper but you might find some more yourself or in other papers citing the present one), and some of its theoretical promises have not been tested in practice.

If you want to contribute and build on this code for:

* better testing the protocol
* developing the protocol further, you are more than welcome to fork this project to your own library

The project has no license and is totally free.
