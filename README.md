# PI-routing_protocol_simulation

> Important, at the end of the development, this code should be the final version of the published paper (if a paper is ever published). Because of that, I would not accept any `pull request` nor any `comit` after the publication. Feel free to fork the project and work on you own, but please don't make any `pull request`, they will be denied.

This file is going to be the read me file of the paper: How to run the code and so on.
