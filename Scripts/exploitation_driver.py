This is the exploitation driver for the game with learning agents.
It is supposed to:
    * Instantiate everything
    * Launch visualizers
    * Run an iteration loop on the environment (During which the Carriers will NOT share their experience
        in a replay buffer ANYMORE)
    * NEVER ask the learning agent to update
    * NEVER change the costs parameters of the Carriers except between experience
